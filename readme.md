# Natours
Welcome Guys! This repo consists of my code for Dev Connectors Project, which I made as a part of my course, MERN Stack Front to Back: Full Stack React, Redux & Node.js. The project consists of 2 different parts:
- A Server-Side API, based on technologies, such as Node, Express & MongoDB. It is published on <a target='_blank' href='https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10118730/TVep8nHM'>Postman</a>.
- A Client-Side rendered website, based on React, which consumes the API. It is hosted on <a target='_blank' href='https://devconnect08.herokuapp.com/'>Heroku</a>. 

# Features  
- A project (API + Website) based on MERN stack. 
- ES6+ Syntax throughout the App
- Async/Await throughout the App
- Authorization from scratch, using <a target="_blank" href = 'https://jwt.io/'>JWT</a>
- Golbal State Management using <a target="_blank" href = 'https://redux.js.org/'>Redux</a>
- Reducers & Actions for our Resources
- Integration of Redux Dev Tools
- Use of React Hooks, and made all the components Functional
- Cutsom Theme using Advanced CSS like Grids, Flexbox etc
